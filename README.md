# Setting up the environment

## To install dependencies

To install dependencies, run the following:

```npm install```

## To run the tests

To run the tests, there is a script in the project root called test. It calculates code coverage, incorporates watch mode, and prints in verbose mode, so all test file's test report will be visible. Alternatively, you can achieve the same with the command the script contains:

```npm test -- --watchAll --collect-coverage --verbose```
